Comfortaa is free for personal/noncommercial use, AND commercial use.

If you like Comfortaa and use it, you are very welcome to leave a donation!
Making fonts is much work and even a very small amount of money will be highly appreciated, encouraging
me to keep making fonts available free of charge.
My paypal account is "aajohan@gmail.com"
(Note that it is entirely up to you if you want to leave a donation, and not doing so should by no means
ethically stop you from using Comfortaa)

Comfortaa is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
http://scripts.sil.org/OFL
This is the standard license of open source fonts and has very few restrictions. Read the "OFL - Font License" file included in the Comfortaa folder for detailed information on the license.

Enjoy! :-)
